# Motivation
This project was created in 36 hours during a hackathon at UCSD. The team's interest in machine learning drove us to using the Clarifai API for image and video recognition. To implement a user input facility and wide range of front end and back end technologies, we developed a web application involving Python (backend) and  HTML, Bootstrap framework, CSS, JS, and flask (frontend).
